for which it was initially developed.	

This package contains:

ELM_MatlabClass.m, 			which is the class implementing the ELM;
example_CLASSIFICATION.m, 	which shows how to use ELM for binary classification;
example_REGRESSION.m, 		which shows how to use ELM for regression problems;
computeAccuracy.m,			which computes classification accuracy of ELM;
computeR2.m,				which computes the coefficient of determination(R^2);
README.MD,					this file;
license.txt,				GNU GPL license.

The UCI datasets breast-cancer-wisconsin.data and data_akbilgic.csv are also 
included as they are used in the examples for CLASSIFICATION and REGRESSION, 
respectively. The datasets are available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/.
Please refer to the UCI website for further information on the datasets.
